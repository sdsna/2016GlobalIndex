# SDG INDEX AND DASHBOARDS REPORT 2016  
## A Global Report
Country-level data from 2016 Index and Dashboards

## Project History
Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by all member states of the United-Nations in 2015, describe a universal agenda that applies to and must be implemented by all countries. Sound metrics and data are critical for turning the SDGs into practical tools for problem solving.

The SDG Index and Dashboards Report is the first worldwide study to assess where each country stands with regard to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Unlike its predecessor the Millennium Development Goals, the SDGs set standards not only for emerging and developing countries, but also for the industrialized nations. Governments and civil society alike can utilize the SDG Index and Dashboards Report to identify priorities for action, understand key implementation challenges, track progress, ensure accountability, and identify gaps that must be closed in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030.

The report is co-produced every year since 2016 by the [Bertelsmann Stiftung](https://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/de/startseite/) and the [Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN)](http://unsdsn.org/). It is a complement to the official SDG indicators and voluntary country-led review processes. The report is not an official monitoring tool. It uses publicly available data published by official data providers (World Bank, WHO, ILO, others) and other organizations including research centers and non-governmental organizations.


## Report Description
The 2016 edition of the SDG Index and Dashboards Report introduced the unofficial SDG Index and Dashboards and summarized the preliminary results. The report created for the first time a measure of the SDG starting point for 2015 at the country level. It was created to help every country identify priorities for early action, understand the key implementation challenges and identify the gaps that must be closed in order to achieve the SDGs by 2030.

The report shows how leaders can deliver on their promise and it urges countries not to lose the momentum for important reforms. In order to achieve the ambitious goals, immediate and comprehensive action is needed in the crucial first years of implementation of the new global agenda. The purpose of this report is to assist countries in getting started with implementing the new SDGs. The SDGs are a universal agenda of sustainable development, calling on all nations to pursue a holistic strategy that combines economic development, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.
